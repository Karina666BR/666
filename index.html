                Happy pride! :D
                I planned on doing the whole song before, to show all of the events of the book. But then it started to get really tragic and depressing so I just decided to focus on the blossom of their relationship instead. Honestly, this is one of my personal favorites.

            <p>I‚Äôve finished it. This is the last animation i did for the my class this year. It was a really big challenge and alot of fun. There is a part in the middle where i got people from my class to draw a frame each. I love that sequence. 

                the "dreamy secuence" is mostly taken from the "true damage" video!  </p>
